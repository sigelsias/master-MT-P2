 reason get conflict answer depend 
 want ground plane   continuous conductor good 
 electrostatic shield   signal board need 
 shielding rom thing   shielding will good magnetic 
 field continuous circuit shield 
 like faraday cage 

 flip coin   work high impedance 
 end capacitance gound plane cause problem 
 likely encounter 100hz 20khz 
 real problem bite

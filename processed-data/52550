   pittsburgh get well people continue support 
   suddenly drop 50 point knee surgery 
 people jump bandwagon

 think accurate   ticket sell people 
 game   think thread discuss season ticket 
 holder la use ticket   effect king 
 initial success follow gretzky arrival 68 91 point source 
 corresponding attendance jump effective drop 
 attendance ticket sale change  

 king winner debatable   claim 
 gretzky arrival competitive claim 
 mcnall stupid try reassemble oiler 
 dynasty story include like 
 mcnall:-     mcnall heavy marketing gretzky 
 undoubtedly responsible attendance merchandising 
 sale etc   say king little 
 tailspin past couple year seat 
 forum ticket sell 

 > think case lemieux gretzky player transcend 
 > win major drawing power  

 short term imo   think inevitable team 
 improve player lemieux gretzky simply 
 people well

 maintain attendance level   seriously doubt 
 case expectation improve team go

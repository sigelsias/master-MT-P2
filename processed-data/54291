	 remind shrapnel   consider 5 reasonable space

 nearby lane range   point 
 distance level threat draw line   
 endangerment 5 restriction possibility 
 shoot draw 1.5 mile restriction nuke 
 draw 5 mile restriction   al suffer fundamental

	 disagree ground house rebuild 
 easily family die   assume word 
 citizen attack plan   
 case tactical strategic implication change 
 bit   personally home worth martians 
 intent take world   family     
 balancing act hard judge sit desk

	 case give heavy 
 weapon commonly own citizenry   low 
 number obviously cost think superior 
 weapon go great effect numerically 
 superior foe   furthermore doubtful training 
 include proper tactical movement well utilize tank 
 commonly rifleman hamper effectiveness

	 envision armorer officer 
 select group like exercise control 
 heavy complex weapon   joe bob own old sherman 
 tank certainly ask   follow order 
 officer yes   expense tank large 
 chance jointly purchase 
 jointly maintain operate

	 agree point   state have control 
 heavy weapon justification state 
 centrally locate   spread 
 ability state lock easy   
 assume state control rest 
 authority governor militia officer

	 have hard time see heavy weapon 
 fairly number easily wield 
 people government support   argue 
 weapon divvy democratic control 
 
 situation alleviate have select militia hold 
 weapon unorganized militia infantry 
 think well mix call   argue 
 federal army rely select militia 
 unorganized militia bulk infantry unit

	 assume 
 government control force 
 equipment infantry force 3x size trouble 
 like heavy stuff tank offset 
 local troup have 105 anti tank weapon 
 armory   useful infantry 
 tank cost training requirement figure 
 suppose quibble constitute heavy equipment

	 resource available 
 outfit local unit   certainly 
 mechanized unit carry stuff fast 
 

 > national guard close conception 
 > select militia think consider 
 > heavy weapon armor arm militia infantry 
 > arm regular army 

	 idea heavy weapon different   think 
 main battle tank self propel artillery 155 mm 
 field piece heavy stuff   m113 troop carrier 2 1/2 ton 
 truck humvee old m60 tank 105 howitzers stuff 
 mechanized infantry   actually guard unit 
 iowa currently field unit 

	 innate fear have real heavy 
 equipment state control little number light 
 stuff act deterrent   allow main battle tank 
 state balance anti tank capability local 
 rank   similarly local unit need band quickly 
 small fast response mean mechanized infantry   finally 
 militia fight   equipment need 
 response   federal army convinced 
 minumum infantry rely state local militia 
 function

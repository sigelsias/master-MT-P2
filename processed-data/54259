 true   go read hear friend 
 basically glock great hear read lot hard 
 learn proper handling type safety   
 look glock .40s&w s&w 4006 couple week ago 
 saftie gun different   saftey 4006 lot 
 safe   lack well word glock   course 
 bad thing pull gun somebody   
 spend time fiddle turn safety   personally 
 like glocks light think look cool 
 guess use movie 
 semi auto safety   prefer training 
 traditional semi auto ala colt .45 course opinion

 unfortunately retail outlet stock 
 chip   stuff stock one 
 sell like standard dram 80386 68000 etc etc 
 i.e.   cna't think stop shopping store 

 close pick copy byte magazine 
 circuit cellar popular electronics like flip 
 

 distributor like wyle electronics hamilton avnet pioneer electronics 
 etc etc normally deal end user like 
 couple deal people buy 
 hundred   distributor represent sell variety 
 different non competing manufacturer   mean 
 suppose abc electronics sell intel 80386   pretty good 
 bet will sell amd 386 vice versa 
 obtain chip want manufacturer 
 represent 

 know   lucky able buy 
 suprise   bear mind 1 2 
 qty price charge great 
 mail order outlet charge 

 advice   go to design try stick 
 shelf stuff   go stuck use 
 esoteric part soon later 

 good luck 

 aaron

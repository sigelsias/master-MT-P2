 think mean global positioning system precision level  
 army application killing accurate today civil  
 one civil precision 20 30 m correct wrong  
 insufficiant mapping building way  
 additional reference point e.g. fix gps system house  
 high precision military version get pretty complicated  
 use microwave system actually mean type radar  
 need lot number crunch accurate vectorized datum  
 original signal gps system well running  
 idea application(there discussion newsgroup  
 know address anymore

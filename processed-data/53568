 hot wire   current flow voltage drop   
 plug heavy load properly wire ground outlet commonly 
 measure volt difference neutral ground

 repeat     strange exception thing 
 like sub panel 

 want prong outlet additional wiring 
 use gfci outlet breaker outlet cheap   fact 
 depend put new outlet(s gfci require

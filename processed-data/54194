 think point miss apparantly acceptable 
 big government big brother use tank control people 
 long use big gun allright 

 tank deploy civilian let fire crew 
 serve weaponry .50 heavy machine gun crew serve 
 press government howl instantly 
 country   civilian shot time 
 light small arm   certainly place people 
 tank real danger   molotov coctail   round rifle 
 pistol deal anybody approach   sniper 
 turn stray cop guard army gunfire 

 know people group net 
 idea tank control civilian 
 pretend free society outrageous   big government feel 
 necessary use kind force stomp protest 
 violent citizen suggest government totally 
 control effectively government declare war 
 people   government live responsibility 
 government people people lord elite 
 want good thing go citizen feel 
 need resort act need squash military 
 boot   people thing like convinced 
 option remain attempt grievance 
 redress ignore   yes criminal element 
 exploit fact remain government 
 unresponsive act apt happen   excuse 
 open civilian tank heavy machine gun 
 old make right philosophy hallmark 
 government go rogue   like tough simply 
 squash iron boot   actually address grievance 
 token fashion huge volume hot air 
 inconvenient   sort variation mushroom management   
 dark smother shit crush ready 

 folk liberal try arrange thing 
 monopoly coercive force firearm 
 expensive toy gutte bill rights cuz 
 progressive fit modern thinking anymore 

 unbelievable 

 believe amid smoke confusion etc real riot situation 
 possible tank away fire main gun 
 building close range   hear explosion 
 explosion   loud go stand like 1000 
 pound bomb tactical nuke   hole blow wall 
 rubble tank knock wall source 
 building turn rubble covering racket 
 gunfire include 50 tack away stand 
 explain musta gas leak   think 
 report condition possible   
 like tank drive quiet street sunday afternoon turn 
 fire know   stand pretty impossible 
 cover

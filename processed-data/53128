 ok ask new thread line 
 ask 

 1 large hole current run resistor 
    i^2 r cool instead heating 

 2 design amplifier preferentially amplifie 
    hole current normal electron current 

 3 semiconductor material high ratio 
    hole mobility electron mobility quote actual 
    test sample estimate base theory 
    limit semiconductor consider insulator 
    resistor dielectric piezo electric conductor 
    magnet metal ceramic magnetostrictive etc 

 note 

    summarize thread far state area 
    hole detectable vacuum hole 
    particle exist presence matter 
    previous thread state hole exist certain 
    semi conductor question naturally arise 
    hole current inside semi conductor vanish point 
    semiconductor join conductor copper 
    want theoretical discussion 
    hole exist inside metal conductor ask 
    experimental discussion amplify detect 
    current exist 
    note cros post sci.electronic 
    electronic discussion 

 thanx

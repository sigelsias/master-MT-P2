 have look couple component catalogue 
 come range peltier effect heat pump intend cool 
 component   hear effect 
 current device pump heat 
   reverse current reverse effect   
 think temperature difference emf 

 strike nice cool hot box 
 picnic power regulator thermostat 
 couple heat sink   big device shift 60w 
 efficiency 80 90 be bad flatten 
 car battery half hour 

 unfortunately catalogue list basic 
 spec heat pump   imagine emf 
 temperature gradient device increase   presumably 
 power decrease emf increase eventually 
 steady state current consume assume 
 leakage   final temperature difference 
 side set supply voltage 
 lousy way control 

 like know 

 1 guess correct 

 2 open circuit thermal resistance typical device 
    want sure coolbox go warm 
    fast unplug 

 3 peltier effect heat pump actually work   look like 
    magic 

 4 use thing domestic fridge freezer 


 thank advance

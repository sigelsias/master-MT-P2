 fool analog job   single chip 
 micro crystal job reliably easily   8748 
 cost $ 5   $ 1 crystal business   embed 
 thing foam insulate blanket power solar cell 
 use excess power heat assembly day rely 
 insulation hold heat darkness   want 
 try thermal management contact like icl cut 
 special low temperature crystal   cost $ 20 

 use single chip micro look part count 
 maybe 7   processor crystal cap crystal power fet 
 fire solenoid flyback diode battery   few part 
 build analog timer infinitely reliable   add 
 power zener diode heat solar cell part count

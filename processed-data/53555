 careful folk consider 90vac+ @20hz force ring 
 tip phone suppose ring   simple zener 
 lead setup end carbon real quick   
 scheme use sure get 200v rate component 
 frontend 

 remember mistaken phone line 600ohm 
 equivalent circuit   current draw 48v get 
 drop 600ohms   fine roughly 
 12v ma bell consider hook   drop 
 far probably big 

 easy implementation accomplish

     ring --------------------------+----------+ 

 suggestion ahead blow hole 
 idea   choose high efficiency led need 
 current light   choose value component 
 require

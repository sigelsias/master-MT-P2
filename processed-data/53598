thing consider time division multiplexe emg 
 channel reduce number rf carrier generate 
 multiplexe emg input 10khz probably 
 sufficient physiology study ~ 330 hz 
 channel sampling rate   level analog multiplexing 
 easy accomplish 

 combine lot rf carrier pretty tricky 
 generate intermodulation   system carry runner 
 fairly harsh environment probably difficult 
 balanced 

 commercial hand hold transciever probably employ 
 little modification accomodate widen bandwidth 
 obviously accordance law 
 govern use transeiver location

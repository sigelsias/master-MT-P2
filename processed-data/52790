 think hangup digital scope know 
 work scope scope basis 
 function typically present opinion 
 counter intuitive fashion hp stride 
 54600 series imo automatic setup fine simple 
 repetitive waveform crazy result 
 complex event need understand scope 
 actually measure process event example scope 
 equivalent time real time sample mode equivalent time 
 mode sample build slowly add delay 
 trigger event sweep scope actual sampling 
 rate time datum massage capture 
 display etc common misconception speed scope 

 hp scope 100 mhz scope 20 mhz 
 sample rate scope ~5 mhz single shot significance 
 end include s h support 100 mhz waveform important 
 equivalent time sampling 100 mhz input case 
 help waveform repetitive single 
 sample lucky hit transient event sample time 

 lot variable understand 
 useful information digital scope prefer analog scope 
 general use digital event need storage 
 later analysis comparison event capability 
 scope price true 100 mhz digital scope 
 fall

	 fortunately wire wrapping well wiring technique 
 high frequency cray computer x mp 
 wirewrappe backplane   wirewrap get trouble 
 high frequency ttl handle   increase 
 wiring capacitance relevant use 
 transmission line technique capacitance problem

	 hand power terrible choice imho 
 field maintenance person maybe dozen connection 
 time   hand cramp   battery power wire wrap gun 
 available $ 150 range little 
 twiddle stick manual type $ 15   modest project 
 couple connection prefer borrow professional 
 ac unit pneumatic

hi 

    build valve preamp use diode capacitor 
 voltage multiplier step 12vac supply voltage approx 
 260vdv load resistance increase rc constant decrease 
 output voltage drop need high output 
 voltage possible 260v 
   circuit consist seven voltage multipli stage 
 ie 14 diode 14 capacitor capacitor develop 38v 
 output seven capacitors=260v 
   capacitor 100mfd 68v 
  increase capacitor rating 220 470mfd 
 increase rc constant alleviate problem 
 capacitor go little expensive need 14 
 

 1 happen connect 470mfd 400v capacitor parallel 
 output parallel seven 100mfd capacitor 
   assume increase c circuit increase 
 rc time constant output voltage 
 stable kill bird stone 
 experience 50hz ripple amp hum new 
 capacitor smooth 

 
 2 recomend suitable value inductor choke 
 place output line power supply filter 
 50hz main hum low resistance possible 

   get preamp moment 
 distraction university get 
 dissertation finish week mail 
 play solderoing iron cheap long 
 run especially 14 new large capacitor work plan

 thank advance

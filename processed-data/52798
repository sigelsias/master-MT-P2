fast n dirty way kill line spike occur 
 inductive load turn zero crossing 
 ac cycle   capacitor kludge etc 

 get microcontroller run bunch valve pump 
 big instrument washer switch 
 zero cross solid state relay stuff stay quiet ac wise 
 steam valve get turn mechanical relay 
 water tank fill thermostat system control 
 ssr generate radiate spike reset 
 peripheral chip   software time try 
 love tack magic spike kill fix avoid have 
 major rewiring redesign   varistor help 
 sufficient   ideas

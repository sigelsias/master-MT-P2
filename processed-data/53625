 project come detector module fast 112 
 250 kb sec packet radio use   fancy modulation scheme 
 wide fsk use 902 1296 mhz 

 bit familiar motorola 3362 chip wonder 
 new design work high input frequency 

 goal come inexpensive design receiver 
 end input end fsk demondulator   
 particularly interested way use high 10.7 
 current chip work 150mhz internal downconversion 
 normal filter 

 suggestion 

 john 

   describe close build describe 
 10th arrl computer network conference proceeding 

   build 10 watt fsk transceiver 904 mhz   essentially 
 double conversion transverter digital mod demod 29 mhz 
 receiver use mc13055 fsk receiver chip 
 previouslyu 2 mbps 10 ghz datum link publish ham 
 radio arrl handbook 

   mc3356 include vhf converter section 
 speed   new slightly improve design 
 mc13056 remember rightly 

   let reduce external count 
 receive offer help transmit 
 bother 

   radio build design build 512 kbps 2 
 mhz channel later reduce half   256 kbps radio 
 actually bench test 384 kbps 
 speed pretty function filter design   handle data 
 stream matter entirely 

   exist radio currently deploy hilltop 
 beacon test mode   end end way datum flow 
 lack resource debug software digital hardware mio 
 show cnc proceeding datum perfect copy n6gn   
 datum clock currently half speed 2 + kbyte 
 test text chapter 55 isaiah take little 1/8 
 second 

   hope interested step 
 involve write code thing usable borland 
 ide environment remote debugging possible mention 
 proceeding date couple run 
 low resource time money energy 

   sf bay area want check cw 
 id text mark 904.740 mhz beacon sonoma 
 mtn black mtn overlook si valley   antenna horizontally 
 polarize 

   guess retrospect suggestion fairly costly 
 approach radio intend user backbone 
 want carefully consider target   
 arrange path complete line sight think 
 want address inter symbol interference cause 
 multipath probably link c n budget path far los 
 detail 10th cnc   currently work spread 
 spectrum direct conversion design address problem 
 glad help design problem

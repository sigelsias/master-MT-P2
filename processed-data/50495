 comment thermal recalibration general new 
 drive perform order increase overall integrity datum 
 write basically firmware instruct actuator perform 
 test datum track certain physical 
 tolerance medium heat cool 
 track drift inevitable drive monitor 
 especially critical high recording density 
 primarily large capacity mechanism 
 find way small drive way 
 boost drive long term reliability mtbf rating 

 aware thermal recalibration point 
 technique conflict prolong write time 
 digitize audio video hard disk manufacturer 
 explicitly state drive thermal recalibration 
 application prolong disk write 

 hope help

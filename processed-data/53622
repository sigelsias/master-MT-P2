 reply see hard number go   trace 
 outside inner layer expect 1 oz copper 15 amp 
 follow temperature rise versus width   sams 
 reference data engineers seventh edition pg 5 30 claim 
 turn mil std-275c 

     width    temp rise 
     inch   degree c 
       
      .125 	 100 
      .15 	  75 
      .17 	  60 
      .20 	  45 
      .24 	  30 
      .33 	  20 

 10 amp rise .125 width 30 degree 
 power go square current plus copper resistance go 
 temperature go   certainly .20 ~5 mm trace 
 ample want   2 ounce copper cut 
 require width half   2 oz 0.08 width 
 think give rate current 10 amp 15 
 transient fault condition 

 question voltage drop low 
 able figure wire table 
 resistivity copper   trace short use separate 
 sensing trace appropriate mention poster

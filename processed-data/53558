 good idea   resolution request 0.3mv 
 order pay noise level well low 
   kind hard noisy box like expect 
 inside pc 

 pay $ $ $ pc card test sample low 
 distortion sine wave think sine wave cd   digital 
 domain   possibly low thd source   run digitize 
 waveform fft transform alook noise floor 
 spectrum   good indication design 
 test data acquistion system design 
 get idea maxim datum sheet 

 live 14 bit resolution recommend look 
 max121 maxim   high speed 308khz complete 
 sample d dsp interface   input range + 5v 
 use serial interface easily optically isolate 
 computer elinimate major noise source   analog design 
 guide get show -100db noise level   claim -77db 
 max -85 typ thd   look pretty good $ 12 1000 piece 

 evaluation kit available   want nice folk
